Wish you could pop out a video, tutorial, or live stream to keep it playing while you work, code, or study?

Slim Window Video Viewer is the tool you need. It isolates any tab into a simple, clean, lite window that's free from the clutter of toolbars and tabs. This creates a true Picture-in-Picture experience anywhere on your desktop, giving you a focused, space-saving viewer for any content. Multitask like a pro!

Key Features:

📺 Floating Player for Multitasking: Opens any page in a separate floating window. Perfect for keeping videos, chats, or reference materials visible while you work.
🚫 Distraction-Free Focus Mode: The slim window has no address bar or unnecessary features. By isolating your content, you can focus on what matters, whether it's an article, a web app, or a video.
💨 Lightweight and Simple: Designed to be a fast, stripped-down version of a browser window. It's efficient, space-saving, and won't slow you down.

✅ Works Everywhere: Use it for YouTube, Twitch, Netflix, online courses, sports, stock tickers, API documentation, and so much more.

🚀 Pro-Tip: How to Enable "Always on Top"
ChromeOS provides a 'floating' option for all windows. 
For other operating systems: make your slim window float above all other applications, you can use free tools available for your OS. This one-time setup unlocks the extension's full potential.
On Windows: We recommend Microsoft PowerToys. It's a free tool from Microsoft. Once installed, just click the slim window and use the shortcut (Win + Ctrl + T) to pin it.
On macOS: Search the App Store for a free "always on top" or "window pinner" utility to enable this functionality.

How It Supercharges Your Workflow:
For the Developer: Keep API documentation or a tutorial visible while you code. No more constant split-screening!
For the Student: Watch lectures and take notes side-by-side on the same screen.
For the Multitasker: Keep an eye on a live event, social feed, or chat window while you work on other tasks.
For the Reader: Pop out an article into a clean, distraction-free window for a focused reading experience.

How to Use:
Navigate to the page or video you want to pop out.
Click the "Slim Window Video Viewer" icon in your browser's toolbar.
Use your OS utility to pin the window so it always stays on top.
Enjoy your new, focused workflow!
