Lean Window Chrome Extension

This is a simple Chrome extension that converts the current browser window into a "lean window" (a window without a toolbar or address bar) with a single click on the extension icon.

Reverting back to a Regular Window

To switch back, right-click on the window's title bar and select the "Open browser window (ctrl+t)" option.

Installation

After installation, the extension's icon will appear in the Chrome toolbar. Click this icon to convert the active window to a lean window.
