# Privacy Policy for Lean Window Extension

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-06

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Lean Window" Chrome Extension ("the Extension") handles information. Our core principle is to collect as little user data as possible. In fact, we collect none.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage

**The Lean Window extension does not collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal data or user information.**

### How the Extension Works:

To provide its functionality, the Extension needs to perform two actions that involve your browser data:

1.  **Read the URL of the active tab:** The Extension reads the URL of your current tab when you click the extension icon.
2.  **Read the dimensions of the active window:** The Extension reads the size and position of your current browser window.

This information is used **solely and ephemerally** for the single purpose of opening the same URL in a new popup-style window with the same dimensions. This data is processed locally on your computer and is **never saved, stored, or transmitted** to any external server or third party. Once the new window is created, the data is discarded.

## 3. Permissions

The Extension requires the `tabs` permission in Chrome. This permission is necessary to access the URL of the active tab, which is essential for the extension's core function. No information accessed via this permission is ever collected or stored.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
